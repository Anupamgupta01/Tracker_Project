Targeting problems like environmental pollution, illegal and untreated waste disposal, and corruption in environmental bodies:-
#### We have made a blockchain-based web application that can, monitor the waste disposed of by the registered factories and industries on the application, involve NGOs in the process of inspection, proceed on general publicâ€™s complaints on these issues, and have a monitoring head that could surveil the whole process.

### The Problem it solves:-
- Removes unethical and illegal practices by industries.
- Removes unethical indulgence of Government officials with these malpractice institutions.
- Involving NGOs to reduce corruption.

### Steps Involved solving the problem:- 
- There will be an admin portal that can add new factories and NGOs to our platform.
- The credentials of the account will be sent to the NGO's email address so that they can login to their portal.
- The Admin can now assign random NGOs to the factories for their inspection.
- The random allocation of NGOs will be done by Chainlink VRF to make the whole process transparent.
- This will ensure that the factories can't predict which NGO will be inspecting this time, thus reducing corruption.
- The allocated NGO will now create a report containing waste disposal stats of the factory. 
- The report collected by the NGOs will be stored directly on the ethereum Blockchain so that the data can't be changed or tempered by anyone.
- The Admin which is a government official can now see all the reports and can take action if he/she find an anomaly. 
- There is also a portal for the general public where they can file any complaint if they are suspicious about the waste disposal of any factory.
- The complaints are also stored on the ethereum blockchain so they can't be deleted or change in any way.
- Public can also upload proofs in the form of photographs/documents which will be stored on IPFS.
